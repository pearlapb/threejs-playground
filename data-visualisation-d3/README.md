#Data Visualisation with D3.js and Three.js

Followed these instructions [here](http://www.storybench.org/how-to-make-a-simple-virtual-reality-data-visualization/) written by Roger Kenny, an interactive designer at the Wall Street Journal.

It was very interesting to see how to use three.js and D3.js together, especially as I have been wanting to work with D3 for a while now.

Now that I've recreated the basics, I want to add:
- Recreate it with another dataset of my choosing from the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/).
- A hover effect on the data bars, as a way to make it more interactive.
- Make 3 other different types of charts and try to play around more with the z-axis.
